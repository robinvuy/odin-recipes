    <p>
        <ol class="wing-steps">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 160°C. Heat 3 inches of oil in a heavy pot to 190°C.</li>
            <li>Add half the chicken wing parts to the oil and fry them until they're golden brown and fully cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the other half of the wing parts.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, heat the cayenne sauce and butter over medium-low heat. Add the Worcestershire and hot sauce. Let it bubble up, and then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Place the wings in an ovenproof dish and pour the hot sauce over the top. Toss to coat, and then bake in the oven for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with blue cheese dip, celery sticks... and your favorite cold, fizzy beverage.</li>
